# Frying Egg Simulator
### Introduction
- This Unity project is developed based on the XR Simulator and uses keyboard and mouse inputs to simulate controller operations.
- The project simulates the everyday activity of frying an egg. Players will find themselves in a cozy and well-lit kitchen, using XR-simulated controllers to interact with objects and complete tasks such as taking out an egg, cracking it, frying it, seasoning, and plating. During this process, players aim to achieve the highest possible score while enjoying a pleasant experience accompanied by relaxing background music.

### Features
1. The scene is filled with interactive objects. Players can interact with furniture and other items using keyboard keys or simulated controllers.
2. The game provides extensive UI assistance to help guide players through the gameplay, offering clear instructions and responsive feedback.
3. Weâ€™ve also designed menu interfaces for both the game start and in-game experience, allowing players to easily pause, restart, or exit the game.
4. The game has a clear beginning and end, with smooth controls that ensure an enjoyable and immersive experience for players!
